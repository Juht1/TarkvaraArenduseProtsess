        Prototyping is defined as the process of developing a working replication of a product or system that has to be engineered. <br/>
        It offers a small-scale facsimile of the end product and is used for obtaining customer feedback. The Prototyping concept is described below: <br/><br/>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The customers get to see the partial product early in the life cycle. This ensures a greater level of customer satisfaction and comfort.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Missing functionalities can be easily figured out.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Errors can be detected much earlier thereby saving a lot of effort and cost, besides enhancing the quality of the software.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Prototyping can help reduce the risk of project failure by identifying potential issues and addressing them early in the process.<br/><br/></li>
         <li>Flexibility in design.<br/><br/></li>
         <li>Prototyping can be used to test and validate design decisions, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant resources are invested in development.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Prototyping can facilitate communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders, improving overall project efficiency and effectiveness.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Prototyping can help bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by providing a tangible representation of the product.<br/><br/></li>
    </ul>

    <p id="whiteoutline" style="color: rgb(0, 21, 255); font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">disadvantages</p><br/>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Costly with respect to time as well as money.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>Poor Documentation due to continuously changing customer requirements.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>There is uncertainty in determining the number of iterations that would be required before the prototype is finally accepted by the customer.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>Developers in a hurry to build prototypes may end up with sub-optimal solutions.<br/><br/></li>
             <li>The prototype may give a false sense of completion, leading to the premature release of the product.<br/><br/></li>
             <li>The prototype may not be scalable to meet the future needs of the customer.<br/><br/></li>
             <li>The prototype may not accurately represent the final product due to limited functionality or incomplete features.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>The prototype may not reflect the actual business requirements of the customer, leading to dissatisfaction with the final product.<br/><br/></li>
        </ul>
