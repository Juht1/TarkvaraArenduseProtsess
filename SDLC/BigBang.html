        The Big bang model is an SDLC model that starts from nothing. It is the simplest model in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) as it requires almost no planning.<br/>
         However, it requires lots of funds and coding and takes more time. The name big bang model was set after the “Great Big Bang” which led to the development of galaxies,<br/>
         stars, planets, etc.Similarly, this SDLC model combines time, efforts, and resources to build a product. The product is gradually built as the requirements from the <br/>
         customer come, however, the end product might not meet the actual requirements.<br/><br/>

        <p id="Waterfall1Text">
            This SDLC model is suitable for small projects when few people are working on the project, the customer’s demands are not exact and keep changing, <br/>
            or if it is a dummy/side-project. As there is no proper planning in this model it is considered the worst SDLC model and is highly unsuitable for<br/>
            large projects.<br/><br/>

            It is recommended to go for the Big Bang model only due to the following cases i.e.<br/>
            <ul style="list-style: lower-greek;">
            <li>Developing a project for learning purposes or experiment purposes.</li>
            <li>No clarity on the requirements from the user side.</li>
            <li>When newer requirements need to be implemented immediately.</li>
            <li>Changing requirements based on the current developing product outcome.</li>
            <li>No strict guideline on product release or delivery date.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Not require a well-documented requirement specification</li>
            <li>Provides a quick overview of the prototype</li>
            <li>Needs little effort and the idea of implementation</li>
